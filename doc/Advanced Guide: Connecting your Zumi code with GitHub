Zumi comes with a version of code already, so first you will need to delete this.
rm -Rf /home/pi/Zumi

Then go to Github.com and sign in as yourself.
Go to https://github.com/RobolinkInc/Zumi and Fork (in the top, right corner)
Click Clone, and copy the URL with the copy icon.

SSH to your Zumi
e.g. ssh pi@zumi.local

Clone the repository that's on your clipboard.
e.g. git clone https://github.com/joonspoon/Zumi.git

Set up your Github credentials.
e.g. git config --global user.name "joonspoon"
e.g. git config --global user.email "joonspoon@joonspoon.com"
