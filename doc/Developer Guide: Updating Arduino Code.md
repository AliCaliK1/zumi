Updating Linky_SerialCom.ino with Arduino

1. Clone Linky repo from https://github.com/RobolinkInc/Linky

2. Open up Arduino

3. Click "File" from the toolbar and "Open"
   - Linky/src/Linky_SerialCom/Linky_SerialCom.ino

3. Connect Linky to the computer with a USB cable. (Make sure the cable is connected to Linky's BLE Board. Not the Raspberry Pi)

4. Turn ON the Linky's power switch. Check for blue LED Light.

5. From the toolbar "Tools," select the type of board that is being used and the correct port. (Board: "Arduino Pro or Pro Mini") (Port: "/dev/cu.SLAB_USBtoUART")

6. Upload the file by either pressing:
  
    1) the right-arrow-button 
    
    or
                    
    2) "sketch" from the toolbar and "upload"

7. At the bottom of the screen, Arduino should say "Done uploading." if you have successfully uploaded the file onto your Linky.
